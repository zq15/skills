# GitHub Skill

Use the `gh` CLI to interact with GitHub. Always specify `--repo owner/repo` when not in a git directory, or use URLs directly.

## Pull Requests

Check CI status on a PR:

```bash
gh pr checks 55 --repo owner/repo
```

List recent workflow runs:

```bash
gh run list --repo owner/repo --limit 10
```

View a run and see which steps failed:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --repo owner/repo
```

View logs for failed steps only:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --repo owner/repo --log-failed
```

## API for Advanced Queries

The `gh api` command is useful for accessing data not available through other subcommands.

Get PR with specific fields:

```bash
gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/55 --jq '.title, .state, .user.login'
```

## JSON Output

Most commands support `--json` for structured output. You can use `--jq` to filter:

```bash
gh issue list --repo owner/repo --json number,title --jq '.[] | "\(.number): \(.title)"'
```

## Creating Issues

`gh issue create` uses GraphQL and may fail with `Resource not accessible by personal access token` even when basic API access works. In that case, fall back to the REST API directly:

```bash
gh api repos/owner/repo/issues \
  --method POST \
  --field title="Issue title" \
  --field body="Issue body"
```

Extract the created issue URL from the response:

```bash
gh api repos/owner/repo/issues \
  --method POST \
  --field title="..." \
  --field body="$(cat draft.md)" \
  2>&1 | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d.get('html_url', d))"
```
